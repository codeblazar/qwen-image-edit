## 🚀 NEXT STEPS FOR YOU

### 1. Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `qwen-image-edit`
3. Description: `AI-powered multi-image editing using Qwen Image Edit 2509 with quantized INT4 models for 24GB VRAM GPUs (RTX 4090)`
4. Public or Private (your choice)
5. Do NOT initialize with README (we have one)
6. Click "Create repository"

### 2. Initialize and Push (run in your terminal with venv active)

```powershell
# Navigate to project
cd C:\Projects\qwen-image-edit

# Initialize git
git init

# Add all files (respects .gitignore)
git add .

# Check what will be committed
git status

# Create initial commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Qwen Image Edit with quantized models

- Complete working setup for RTX 4090 24GB VRAM
- Quantized INT4 model support via nunchaku
- Full installation documentation
- Windows PowerShell scripts for setup
- Successfully tested image generation (2:44 inference time)"

# Add GitHub remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/qwen-image-edit.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. After Upload
- [ ] Add topics/tags on GitHub: `ai`, `image-editing`, `pytorch`, `cuda`, `qwen`, `quantization`, `rtx-4090`
- [ ] Add license file (MIT or Apache 2.0 recommended)
- [ ] Create releases (v1.0.0 - Initial working release)
- [ ] Optional: Add badges to README (Python version, license, stars)
