# API Hardening Implementation

## Overview
Implemented 5 critical hardening improvements to make the API production-ready and robust against crashes, race conditions, and abuse.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Async Locks for Concurrency Protection âœ…
**Problem:** Multiple concurrent requests could cause race conditions, corrupted state, or GPU memory conflicts.

**Solution:**
- Added `asyncio.Lock()` for model loading (`_model_lock`)
- Added `asyncio.Lock()` for image generation (`_generation_lock`)
- Only one model load operation at a time
- Only one image generation at a time
- Returns 409 Conflict if operation already in progress

**Files Modified:**
- `pipeline_manager.py`: Added locks to `__init__`, made `load_model()` and `generate_image()` async
- `main.py`: Updated endpoints to check `is_loading` and `is_generating` states

---

### 2. Request Validation (Input Sanitization) âœ…
**Problem:** No limits on image size, dimensions, or instruction length could cause OOM errors or crashes.

**Solution:**
- **Image Size:** Max 10MB (configurable via `MAX_IMAGE_SIZE_MB`)
- **Image Dimensions:** Max 2048x2048 pixels (configurable via `MAX_IMAGE_DIMENSION`)
- **Instruction Length:** Max 500 characters (configurable via `MAX_INSTRUCTION_LENGTH`)
- **Image Format:** Only JPEG/PNG allowed

**Validation Order** (fails fast on bad input):
1. Instruction length
2. Image format (MIME type)
3. Image file size
4. Image dimensions
5. Model loaded check
6. Busy state check

---

### 3. Timeouts for Long Operations âœ…
**Problem:** Model loading or generation could hang indefinitely, locking up the API.

**Solution:**
- **Model Loading Timeout:** 180 seconds (3 minutes)
- **Generation Timeout:** 300 seconds (5 minutes)
- Returns 504 Gateway Timeout if exceeded

---

### 4. Improved File Naming (Prevents Race Conditions) âœ…
**Problem:** Sequential numbering had race conditions.

**Solution:**
- **New Format:** `{model}_{timestamp}_s{seed}_{uuid}.png`
- **Example:** `qwen04_20251006_143025_s1234567890_a3f2e9b1.png`
- Guaranteed unique via timestamp + seed + UUID

---

### 5. Enhanced Health Endpoint âœ…
The `/api/v1/health` endpoint now shows detailed operation state:

```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "current_model": "4-step",
  "model_loaded": true,
  "is_loading": false,
  "is_generating": false
}
```

---

## Rate Limiting (Explained, Not Implemented)

### What is Rate Limiting?
Controls how many requests a user can make in a time window.

### Why You Need It
- Image generation takes 20-180 seconds per request
- Without limits, someone could queue 100 requests â†’ lock GPU for hours
- Protects against accidental runaway scripts or DoS attacks

### Current Implementation (Option 1: Simple Concurrency Limit)
âœ… **Already implemented via locks**
- Only 1 model load at a time
- Only 1 generation at a time
- Returns 409 Conflict if busy

**Recommendation:** Current implementation is sufficient for single-user via Cloudflare tunnel.

## Configuration Reference

All parameters are configurable at the top of `main.py`:

```python
MAX_IMAGE_SIZE_MB = 10              # Maximum upload size
MAX_IMAGE_DIMENSION = 2048          # Maximum width or height  
MAX_INSTRUCTION_LENGTH = 500        # Maximum instruction text length
GENERATION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 300    # 5 minute timeout
MODEL_LOAD_TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 180    # 3 minute timeout
```

---

## Testing

### Workflow Tests
```bash
python test_workflow.py    # 8/8 passed âœ“
```

### Hardening Tests
```bash
python test_hardening.py   # 6/6 passed âœ“
```

## Error Codes

| Code | Meaning | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| 400 | Bad Request | Invalid image, too large, no model loaded |
| 401 | Unauthorized | Invalid API key |
| 409 | Conflict | Operation already in progress |
| 504 | Timeout | Exceeded timeout limit |
| 500 | Internal Error | Unexpected error |

---

## Summary

**Fragility Assessment:** Reduced from **MEDIUM-HIGH** to **LOW** âœ…

| Improvement | Before | After |
|------------|--------|-------|
| **Concurrency** | Race conditions | Protected with locks âœ… |
| **Input Validation** | None | Size/dimension/format limits âœ… |
| **Timeouts** | Could hang forever | 3-5 minute timeouts âœ… |
| **File Naming** | Race conditions | UUID-based unique names âœ… |
| **Error Messages** | Generic 500 errors | Specific error codes âœ… |
| **Operation State** | Unknown if busy | `/health` shows state âœ… |

The API is now production-ready! ðŸŽ‰
