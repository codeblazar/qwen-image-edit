Qwen Image Edit Project - TODO List
====================================

IMPROVEMENTS IDENTIFIED FROM OUTPUT:
====================================

[ ] Install hf_xet for better download performance
    Command: pip install hf_xet
    OR: pip install huggingface_hub[hf_xet]
    Benefit: Faster model downloads from Hugging Face Hub using Xet Storage
    Issue: Warning appears 8 times during download (spammy)

[ ] Suppress/handle repeated "Xet Storage" warnings
    Currently: Same warning printed 8+ times
    Solution: Either install hf_xet or suppress duplicate warnings

[✓] Move generated images to organized folder
    COMPLETED: generated-images/ folder created
    Format: generated-images/output_r128_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.png
    Benefit: Project root clean, outputs organized by timestamp

[ ] Handle torch_dtype deprecation warning
    Warning: "`torch_dtype` is deprecated! Use `dtype` instead!"
    Fix: Update code to use `dtype` parameter instead of `torch_dtype`

[ ] Suppress guidance_scale warning for non-guidance-distilled models
    Warning: "guidance_scale is passed as 1.0, but ignored since the model is not guidance-distilled."
    Fix: Either remove guidance_scale=1.0 or suppress this expected warning

[ ] Handle unexpected config attributes warning
    Warning: "The config attributes {'pooled_projection_dim': 768} were passed to NunchakuQwenImageTransformer2DModel, but are not expected"
    Issue: Benign warning from model config mismatch
    Fix: Update nunchaku model config or suppress this warning

[ ] Add progress indicators/cleaner output
    Current: Multiple progress bars and warnings intermixed
    Improvement: Better organized output, maybe logging levels

[✓] Add timestamp to generated image filenames
    COMPLETED: Now uses format output_r128_20251002_085316.png
    Benefit: Never overwrites previous generations
      - Easy to find all outputs
      - Can add to .gitignore
      - Organize by date/prompt
    Implementation:
      - Create folder if not exists
      - Save with timestamp: generated/20251002_085316_r128.png
      - Optionally save prompt as metadata .txt file

====================================
Completed Tasks:
====================================

[✓] Set up virtual environment (.venv)
[✓] Install PyTorch 2.5.1+cu121 with CUDA support
[✓] Install diffusers 0.36.0.dev0 from GitHub
[✓] Install Visual Studio Build Tools 2022 with C++ components
[✓] Patch PyTorch to bypass CUDA version check (13.0 vs 12.1)
[✓] Compile and install nunchaku from source with git submodules
[✓] Verify nunchaku installation (NunchakuQwenImageTransformer2DModel)
[✓] Successfully run qwen_image_edit_nunchaku.py
[✓] Generated first image successfully (2:44 inference time, 40 steps)
